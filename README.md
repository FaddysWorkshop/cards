# Example: Function Scenario for 
Blackjack Game

Based on the explanation generated by ChatGPT for the Blackjack game, let's write Blackjack game for the command-line to demonstrate Function Scenarios.

## ChatGPT's Explanation for How to Play Blackjack

Playing Blackjack is quite straightforward. Here's a simple explanation:

1. The Goal: The main objective in Blackjack is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21.

2. Card Values: Cards two through ten are worth their face value. Kings, Queens, and Jacks are each worth ten. Aces can be worth one or eleven, whichever benefits the player more.

3. The Game Start: The game starts with each player, including the dealer, being dealt two cards. Usually, one of the dealer's cards is face up so players can see it.

4. Player's Turn: Players then decide how to play their hand. The basic choices are to 'hit' (take another card) or 'stand' (keep their current hand). Players can continue hitting until they choose to stand or until their hand exceeds 21, known as a 'bust'.

5. Dealer's Turn: After all players have finished their turns, the dealer plays their hand. The dealer typically must hit until their cards total 17 or higher.

6. Comparing Hands: If you don't bust and your total is higher than the dealer's, you win. If both you and the dealer have the same total, it's a 'push', and your bet is returned. If the dealer busts and you don't, you win.

7. Special Options: 
   - **Blackjack**: If your first two cards are an ace and a 'ten-card' (a 10 or a face card), you have a 'Blackjack', which usually pays 3 to 2.
   - **Splitting**: If your first two cards are of the same value, you can 'split' them into two separate hands.
   - **Doubling Down**: You can double your bet on certain hands, in exchange for committing to stand after receiving one more card.

The rules can vary slightly by casino, so it's always a good idea to check the specific rules of the place you're playing. Blackjack is popular because it's easy to learn, but it also involves strategy and decision-making.

### An Example Scenario for the Game in Action

Also generated by ChatGPT:

Sure! Let's walk through a hypothetical single-player Blackjack game to illustrate how it's played:

1. **Initial Deal**: 
   - The player is dealt two cards: a 7 of hearts and a 5 of clubs, making a total of 12.
   - The dealer has one card face up, a 6 of spades, and one card face down.

2. **Player's Decision**: 
   - The player decides to 'hit', hoping to get closer to 21 without going over.
   - The player gets a 9 of diamonds. This brings their total to 21 (7 + 5 + 9).

3. **Dealer's Turn**: 
   - The dealer reveals their face-down card, which is a 10 of hearts. Their total is now 16 (6 + 10).
   - The dealer must hit on 16. They draw a 5 of spades, making their total 21 (6 + 10 + 5).

4. **Outcome**:
   - Both the player and the dealer have 21, so the game is a 'push'. The player's bet is returned, and the game ends in a draw.

In this scenario, the player made a good decision to hit on 12 against a dealer's 6, and it paid off by bringing them to 21. However, the dealer also reached 21, resulting in a tie. In Blackjack, it's not just about your decisions; the dealer's hand also plays a significant role in the outcome.
